I recently graduated UCLA with Highest Honors in Political Science and a minor in Statistics and Data Science. I was formerly a Keck Research Fellow, a member of College Honors, and the Vice Chair for the 2023-2024 Student Fee Advisory Committee. My research interests are in quantitative methods (particularly causal inference with panel data) and the political economy of climate and development.

My research experience includes working as a Research Assistant for Cesi Cruz, Paul Bahk, and Jose Gloria. My main responsibility was conducting spatial data analysis on gridded data in Sierra Leone, to estimate subnational inequality in the absence of official data. I also wrote my Honors thesis under the mentorship of Michael L. Ross, where I explored the political economy of climate policy in U.S. state legislatures, with close attention paid to the distributive conflict between fossil fuel interests and clean energy advocates.

I will be applying to PhD programs this cycle, and am completing an independent project funded by The Green Initiative Fund and the UCLA Honors College in the meantime, relating to machine learning applications for synthetic control.
