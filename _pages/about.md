I am a Keck Research Fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), interested in political economy and quantitative methods for causal inference.

At UCLA, I study Political Science with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. I will graduate this Spring with Departental Highest Honors and College Honors.
I have been awarded the Keck Humanistic Inquiry, Rosalind W. Alcott, and Research Revealed scholarships.

I wrote my honors thesis under the mentorship of Michael L. Ross, entitled "[The Influence of Political Ideology on Carbon Emissions.](https://github.com/eigenstuffs/thesis)" I ask whether liberal
state legislatures are associated with lower emissions, and ask whether the effect is greater for renewable energy or energy efficiency outcomes. My results suggest immense implementation barriers
for renewable energy policy, even in states where political will is strong.

Additionally, I am a Research Assistant for Cesi Cruz, Jose Gloria, and Paul Bahk, where I've conducted literature review and spatial data analyses. I also work at the UCLA Library as an IT Consultant,
and serve as the Vice Chair of the UCLA Student Fee Advisory Committee, where we collectively advise the Chancellor on the distribution of nearly $50 million annually.

My current projects include a method to produce synthetic controls with machine learning and a network analysis of Congressional voting records.
