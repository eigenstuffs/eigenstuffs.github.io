I am a Highest Honors Political Science graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. I will be applying to PhD programs this cycle for Fall '25 entry.

My research interests are in political economy and causal inference. I am principally interested in applying spatial data to study how exposure to climate risk alters political behavior. My other interests estimators that loosen functional form assumptions, text mining, and the implementation of interpretable machine learning methods to causal inference.

I currently work for Professors Cesi Cruz and Daniel N. Posner as a Research Assistant. My tasks are distributed between working with panel data, spatial data, and creating reproducable code. I wrote my honors thesis under the supervision of Professor Michael L. Ross, for which I earned a perfect grade and Departmental Highest Honors. I presented during Undergraduate Research Week twice and the UIRA Poster Day event. I was a Keck Research Fellow for the 2023-24 academic year and was formerly awarded funding from UCLA's Green Initiative Fund, College Honors, and Undergraduate Research Center.
